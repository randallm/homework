Filling out the Data Table
=====================================

m: The number that corresponds to the linear plot you got in Part 1 Trial 1

n: The number that corresponds to the linear plot you got in Part 3 Trial 2

Overall Order: m + n (should end up being 2 because this is a pseudo-1st order reaction)

Rate Expression: Rate = k [Dye]^m [NaOCl]^n

k (Rate Constant):
* Pseudo Rate Constant B = k[NaOCl]^n
* Solve for k.


Notes
-----

* The rate you get from Part 1 Trial 1 is insignificant because this is pseudo-first-order and this calculation doesn't factor in B yet?
* The concentration of dye is never given to you and it doesn't matter because your calculations are done with NaOCl because that's reactant B
